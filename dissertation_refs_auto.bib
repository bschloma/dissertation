	abstract = {UNLABELLED The vertebrate intestine is home to microbial ecosystems that play key roles in host development and health. Little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of these microbial communities, limiting our understanding of fundamental properties, such as their mechanisms of growth, propagation, and persistence. To address this, we inoculated initially germ-free zebrafish larvae with fluorescently labeled strains of an Aeromonas species, representing an abundant genus in the zebrafish gut. Using light sheet fluorescence microscopy to obtain three-dimensional images spanning the gut, we quantified the entire bacterial load, as founding populations grew from tens to tens of thousands of cells over several hours. The data yield the first ever measurements of the growth kinetics of a microbial species inside a live vertebrate intestine and show dynamics that robustly fit a logistic growth model. Intriguingly, bacteria were nonuniformly distributed throughout the gut, and bacterial aggregates showed considerably higher growth rates than did discrete individuals. The form of aggregate growth indicates intrinsically higher division rates for clustered bacteria, rather than surface-mediated agglomeration onto clusters. Thus, the spatial organization of gut bacteria both relative to the host and to each other impacts overall growth kinetics, suggesting that spatial characterizations will be an important input to predictive models of host-associated microbial community assembly. IMPORTANCE Our intestines are home to vast numbers of microbes that influence many aspects of health and disease. Though we now know a great deal about the constituents of the gut microbiota, we understand very little about their spatial structure and temporal dynamics in humans or in any animal: how microbial populations establish themselves, grow, fluctuate, and persist. To address this, we made use of a model organism, the zebrafish, and a new optical imaging technique, light sheet fluorescence microscopy, to visualize for the first time the colonization of a live, vertebrate gut by specific bacteria with sufficient resolution to quantify the population over a range from a few individuals to tens of thousands of bacterial cells. Our results provide unprecedented measures of bacterial growth kinetics and also show the influence of spatial structure on bacterial populations, which can be revealed only by direct imaging.},

An implicit assumption of microbiome profiling for diagnostic purposes is that the proportional representation of different taxa determine host phenotypes. To test this assumption, we colonized gnotobiotic zebrafish with zebrafish-derived bacterial isolates and measured bacterial abundance and host neutrophil responses. Surprisingly, combinations of bacteria elicited immune responses that do not reflect the numerically dominant species. These data are consistent with a quantitative model in which the host responses to commensal species are additive but where various species have different per capita immunostimulatory effects. For example, one species has a high per capita immunosuppression that is mediated through a potent secreted factor. We conclude that the proportional representation of bacteria in a community does not necessarily predict its functional capacities; however, characterizing specific properties of individual species offers predictive insights into multi-species community function.},

Potential benefits of motility include increased efficiency of nutrient acquisition, avoidance of toxic substances, the ability to translocate to preferred hosts and access optimal colonization sites within them, and dispersal in the environment during the course of transmission. The costs of motility also may be significant. These include the metabolic burden of synthesizing flagellar components, the energetic expense of fuelling flagellar motors and the presentation of polymeric and highly antigenic targets to the immune system. It is therefore not surprising that synthesis of the motility apparatus is usually subject to strict control.

The postnatal period is particularly critical for the development of microbiota composition, host-microbe interactions and immune homeostasis7-9. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this neonatal priming period have not been defined. Here we report the identification of a host-mediated regulatory circuit of bacterial colonization that acts solely during the early neonatal period but influences life-long microbiota composition. We demonstrate age-dependent expression of the flagellin receptor Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in the gut epithelium of neonate mice. Using competitive colonization experiments, we demonstrate that epithelial TLR5-mediated REG3γ production is critical for the counter-selection of colonizing flagellated bacteria. Comparative microbiota transfer experiments in neonate and adult wild-type and Tlr5-deficient germ-free mice reveal that neonatal TLR5 expression strongly influences the composition of the microbiota throughout life. Thus, the beneficial microbiota in the adult host is shaped during early infancy. This might explain why environmental factors that disturb the establishment of the microbiota during early life can affect immune homeostasis and health in adulthood.},

We find that mice lacking the flagellin receptor Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) exhibit a profound loss of flagellin-specific immunoglobulins (Igs) despite higher total Ig levels in the gut. Ribotyping of IgA-coated cecal microbiota showed Proteobacteria evading antibody coating in the TLR5(-/-) gut. A diversity of microbiome members overexpressed flagellar genes in the TLR5(-/-) host. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes penetrated small intestinal villi, and flagellated bacteria breached the colonic mucosal barrier. In vitro, flagellin-specific Ig inhibited bacterial motility and downregulated flagellar gene expression. Thus, innate-immunity-directed development of flagellin-specific adaptive immune responses can modulate the microbiome's production of flagella in a three-way interaction that helps to maintain mucosal barrier integrity and homeostasis.},

We hypothesized that this dynamic environment is a prerequisite for a balanced microbial community and that the enteric nervous system (ENS), a chief regulator of physiological processes within the gut, profoundly influences gut microbiota composition. We found that zebrafish lacking an ENS due to a mutation in the Hirschsprung disease gene, sox10, develop microbiota-dependent inflammation that is transmissible between hosts. Profiling microbial communities across a spectrum of inflammatory phenotypes revealed that increased levels of inflammation were linked to an overabundance of pro-inflammatory bacterial lineages and a lack of anti-inflammatory bacterial lineages. Moreover, either administering a representative anti-inflammatory strain or restoring ENS function corrected the pathology.

This system, which we call CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in Escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. CRISPRi can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. We also show evidence that the system can be adapted for gene repression in mammalian cells.

	abstract = {Why is motility so common in bacteria? An obvious answer to this ecological and evolutionary question is that in almost all habitats, bacteria need to go someplace and particularly in the direction of food. Although the machinery required for motility and chemotaxis (acquiring and processing the information needed to direct movement toward nutrients) are functionally coupled in contemporary bacteria, they are coded for by different sets of genes. Moreover, information that resources are more abundant elsewhere in a habitat would be of no value to a bacterium unless it already had the means to get there. Thus, motility must have evolved before chemotaxis, and bacteria with flagella and other machinery for propulsion in random directions must have an advantage over bacteria relegated to moving at the whim of external forces alone. However, what are the selection pressures responsible for the evolution and maintenance of undirected motility in bacteria? Here we use a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments with Escherichia coli to generate and test a parsimonious and ecologically general hypothesis for the existence of undirected motility in bacteria: it enables bacteria to move away from each other and thereby obtain greater individual shares of resources in physically structured environments. The results of our experiments not only support this hypothesis, but are quantitatively and qualitatively consistent with the predictions of our model.},

Transient high levels of proteobacteria, especially enterobacteria species including E. coli, observed in close proximity to the gut epithelium were a striking feature of colitic microbiota.

Multilevel physical and chemical communication systems among constituent organisms underlie polymicrobial synergy and dictate the community's pathogenic potential or nososymbiocity, that is, disease arising from living together with a susceptible host. Functional specialization of community participants, often originating from metabolic codependence, has given rise to several newly appreciated designations within the commensal-to-pathogen spectrum. Accessory pathogens, while inherently commensal in a particular microenvironment, nonetheless enhance the colonization or metabolic activity of pathogens. Keystone pathogens (bacterial drivers or alpha-bugs) exert their influence at low abundance by modulating both the composition and levels of community participants and by manipulating host responses. Pathobionts (or bacterial passengers) exploit disrupted host homeostasis to flourish and promote inflammatory disease.

Specific immune recognition facilitated bacterial adherence to cultured intestinal epithelial cells and intimate association with the gut mucosal surface in vivo. The IgA response was required for B. fragilis, and other commensal species, to occupy a defined mucosal niche that mediated stable colonization of the gut through exclusion of exogenous competitors.

The key defining feature of biofilms is adhesion, whereby cells attach to one another and to surfaces, via attachment factors and extracellular polymers. While adhesion is known to be important for the initial stages of biofilm formation, its function within biofilm communities has not been studied. Here we utilise an individual-based model of microbial groups to study the evolution of adhesion. While adhering to a surface can enable cells to remain in a biofilm, consideration of within-biofilm competition reveals a potential cost to adhesion: immobility. Highly adhesive cells that are resistant to movement face being buried and starved at the base of the biofilm. However, we find that when growth occurs at the base of a biofilm, adhesion allows cells to capture substratum territory and force less adhesive, competing cells out of the system. This process may be particularly important when cells grow on a host epithelial surface. We test the predictions of our model using the enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae, which produces an extracellular matrix important for biofilm formation. Flow cell experiments indicate that matrix-secreting cells are highly adhesive and form expanding clusters that remove non-secreting cells from the population, as predicted by our simulations. Our study shows how simple physical properties, such as adhesion, can be critical to understanding evolution and competition within microbial communities.},

These interactions are thought to influence microbial succession, community stability, syntrophic relationships, and resiliency in the face of perturbations. The complexity and dynamism of the gut microbiota pose considerable challenges for quantitative analysis of its spatial organization. Here, we illustrate an approach for addressing this challenge, using ( i ) a model, defined 15-member consortium of phylogenetically diverse, sequenced human gut bacterial strains introduced into adult gnotobiotic mice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet, and ( ii ) in situ hybridization and spectral imaging analysis methods that allow simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial strains at multiple spatial scales. Differences in the binding affinities of strains for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, could, in principle, lead to localized clonally expanded aggregates composed of one or a few taxa. However, our results reveal a colonic community that is mixed at micrometer scales, with distinct spatial distributions of some taxa relative to one another, notably at the border between the mucosa and the lumen. Our data suggest that lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon should be conceptualized not as stratified compartments but as components of an incompletely mixed bioreactor.

	abstract = {Although competition-dispersal tradeoffs are commonly invoked to explain species coexistence for animals and plants in spatially structured environments, such mechanisms for coexistence remain unknown for microorganisms. Here we show that two recently speciated marine bacterioplankton populations pursue different behavioral strategies to exploit nutrient particles in adaptation to the landscape of ephemeral nutrient patches characteristic of ocean water. These differences are mediated primarily by differential colonization of and dispersal among particles. Whereas one population is specialized to colonize particles by attaching and growing biofilms, the other is specialized to disperse among particles by rapidly detecting and swimming toward new particles, implying that it can better exploit short-lived patches. Because the two populations are very similar in their genomic composition, metabolic abilities, chemotactic sensitivity, and swimming speed, this fine-scale behavioral adaptation may have been responsible for the onset of the ecological differentiation between them. These results demonstrate that the principles of spatial ecology, traditionally applied at macroscales, can be extended to the ocean's microscale to understand how the rich spatiotemporal structure of the resource landscape contributes to the fine-scale ecological differentiation and species coexistence among marine bacteria.},

	volume = {46},
	abstract = {The bacterial flagellum is an amazingly complex molecular machine with a diversity of roles in pathogenesis including reaching the optimal host site, colonization or invasion, maintenance at the infection site, and post-infection dispersal. Multi-megadalton flagellar motors self-assemble across the cell wall to form a reversible rotary motor that spins a helical propeller - the flagellum itself - to drive the motility of diverse bacterial pathogens. The flagellar motor responds to the chemoreceptor system to redirect swimming toward beneficial environments, thus enabling flagellated pathogens to seek out their site of infection. At their target site, additional roles of surface swimming and mechanosensing are mediated by flagella to trigger pathogenesis. Yet while these motility-related functions have long been recognized as virulence factors in bacteria, many bacteria have capitalized upon flagellar structure and function by adapting it to roles in other stages of the infection process. Once at their target site, the flagellum can assist adherence to surfaces, differentiation into biofilms, secretion of effector molecules, further penetration through tissue structures, or in activating phagocytosis to gain entry into eukaryotic cells. Next, upon onset of infection, flagellar expression must be adapted to deal with the host's immune system defenses, either by reduced or altered expression or by flagellar structural modification. Finally, after a successful growth phase on or inside a host, dispersal to new infection sites is often flagellar motility-mediated. Examining examples of all these processes from different bacterial pathogens, it quickly becomes clear that the flagellum is involved in bacterial pathogenesis for motility and a whole lot more.},

Transcriptional circuits are layered by using promoters to carry the signal between circuits. In other words, the output promoter of one circuit serves as the input promoter to the next. Thus, connecting circuits requires physically connecting a promoter to the next circuit. We show that the sequence at the junction between the input promoter and circuit can affect the input-output response (transfer function) of the circuit. A library of putative sequences that might reduce (or buffer) such context effects, which we refer to as 'insulator parts', is screened in Escherichia coli. We find that ribozymes that cleave the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the mRNA are effective insulators. They generate quantitatively identical transfer functions, irrespective of the identity of the input promoter. When these insulators are used to join synthetic gene circuits, the behavior of layered circuits can be predicted using a mathematical model. The inclusion of insulators will be critical in reliably permuting circuits to build different programs.},

However, work in recent years has brought to light the importance of inter-host transmission and its influence on microbiome composition and dynamics. We now appreciate that microbiomes do not exist in isolation, but exchange constituents with the microbial communities of other hosts and the environment. Moving forward, fully understanding the role of transmission in microbiome assembly and dynamics will require a high-resolution view of the colonization and persistence patterns of particular microbial lineages (i.e. strains) across individuals and the environment. Yet, accomplishing this level of resolution will be an immense challenge, requiring improved sampling and bioinformatics approaches as well as employment of tractable experimental models.

This has made it difficult to identify consistent host factors that explain variation in microbiomes across hosts, despite large-scale sampling efforts. While ecological theory predicts that the movement, or dispersal, of individuals can have profound and predictable consequences on community assembly, its role in the assembly of animal-associated microbiomes remains underexplored. Here, we show that dispersal of microorganisms among hosts can contribute substantially to microbiome variation, and is able to overwhelm the effects of individual host factors, in an experimental test of ecological theory. We manipulated dispersal among wild-type and immune-deficient myd88 knockout zebrafish and observed that interhost dispersal had a large effect on the diversity and composition of intestinal microbiomes. Interhost dispersal was strong enough to overwhelm the effects of host factors, largely eliminating differences between wild-type and immune-deficient hosts, regardless of whether dispersal occurred within or between genotypes, suggesting dispersal can independently alter the ecology of microbiomes. Our observations are consistent with a predictive model that assumes metacommunity dynamics and are likely mediated by dispersal-related microbial traits. These results illustrate the importance of microbial dispersal to animal microbiomes and motivate its integration into the study of host-microbe systems.},

This diurnal microbial behavior drives, in turn, the global programming of the host circadian transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolite oscillations. Surprisingly, disruption of homeostatic microbiome rhythmicity not only abrogates normal chromatin and transcriptional oscillations of the host, but also incites genome-wide de novo oscillations in both intestine and liver, thereby impacting diurnal fluctuations of host physiology and disease susceptibility. As such, the rhythmic biogeography and metabolome of the intestinal microbiota regulates the temporal organization and functional outcome of host transcriptional and epigenetic programs.},

	abstract = {Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the motile Gram-negative rod Vibrio cholerae. Live-attenuated V. cholerae vaccines harboring deletions of the genes encoding cholera toxin have great promise for reducing the global burden of cholera. However, development of live vaccines has been hampered by the tendency of such strains to induce noncholeric reactogenic diarrhea in human subjects. The molecular bases of reactogenicity are unknown, but it has been speculated that reactogenic diarrhea is a response to V. cholerae's flagellum and/or the motility that it enables. Here, we used an infant rabbit model of reactogenicity to determine what V. cholerae factors trigger this response. We found that V. cholerae ctx mutants that produced flagellins induced diarrhea, regardless of whether the proteins were assembled into a flagellum or whether the flagellum was functional. In contrast, approximately 90\% of rabbits infected with V. cholerae lacking all five flagellin-encoding genes did not develop diarrhea. Thus, flagellin production, independent of flagellum assembly or motility, is sufficient for reactogenicity. The intestinal colonization and intraintestinal localization of the nonreactogenic flagellin-deficient strain were indistinguishable from those of a flagellated motile strain; however, the flagellin-deficient strain stimulated fewer mRNA transcripts coding for proinflammatory cytokines in the intestine. Thus, reactogenic diarrhea may be a consequence of an innate host inflammatory response to V. cholerae flagellins. Our results suggest a simple genetic blueprint for engineering defined nonreactogenic live-attenuated V. cholerae vaccine strains.},

Purpose of review Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the distal hindgut, extending from the rectum to a variable distance proximally, and results from a failure of cranial-caudal neural crest cell migration. Hirschsprung's-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a condition with classic manifestations that include abdominal distention, fever and foul-smelling stools, and is a significant and life-threatening complication of HSCR. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate recent findings regarding the pathophysiology of HAEC. Recent findings Several recent studies have investigated the cause of HAEC in humans and mouse models. These studies suggest that alterations in the intestinal barrier, including goblet cell number and function, and Paneth cell function, impaired gastrointestinal mucosal immunity, including B-lymphocyte trafficking or function and secretory immunoglobulin A production, and dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development of HAEC. Summary Recent studies add to the body of literature, suggesting that the intestinal defects observed in HSCR are not restricted to the aganglionic segment but extend to the mucosal immune system within and beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Future studies further dissecting the mechanisms of HAEC and validating these findings in humans will allow for the development of directed therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiota is a complex consortium of microorganisms with the ability to influence important aspects of host health and development. Harnessing this "microbial organ" for biomedical applications requires clarifying the degree to which host and bacterial factors act alone or in combination to govern the stability of specific lineages. To address this issue, we combined bacteriological manipulation and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to monitor the dynamics of a defined two-species microbiota within a vertebrate gut. We observed that the interplay between each population and the gut environment produces distinct spatiotemporal patterns. As a consequence, one species dominates while the other experiences sudden drops in abundance that are well fit by a stochastic mathematical model. Modeling revealed that direct bacterial competition could only partially explain the observed phenomena, suggesting that a host factor is also important in shaping the community. We hypothesized the host determinant to be gut motility, and tested this mechanism by measuring colonization in hosts with enteric nervous system dysfunction due to a mutation in the ret locus, which in humans is associated with the intestinal motility disorder known as Hirschsprung disease. In mutant hosts we found reduced gut motility and, confirming our hypothesis, robust coexistence of both bacterial species. This study provides evidence that host-mediated spatial structuring and stochastic perturbation of communities can drive bacterial population dynamics within the gut, and it reveals a new facet of the intestinal host-microbe interface by demonstrating the capacity of the enteric nervous system to influence the microbiota. Ultimately, these findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting the intestinal ecosystem should consider the dynamic physical nature of the gut environment.},

At 10 dpf, axenic zebrafish exhibited hyperactivity compared to conventionalized and conventionally colonized controls. Impairment of host colonization using antibiotics also caused hyperactivity in conventionally colonized larvae. To determine whether there is a developmental requirement for microbial colonization, axenic embryos were serially colonized on 1, 3, 6, or 9 dpf and evaluated on 10 dpf. Normal activity levels were observed in axenic larvae colonized on 1–6 dpf, but not on 9 dpf. Colonization of axenic embryos at 1 dpf with individual bacterial species Aeromonas veronii or Vibrio cholerae was sufficient to block locomotor hyperactivity at 10 dpf. Exposure to heat-killed bacteria or microbe-associated molecular patterns pam3CSK4 or Poly(I:C) was not sufficient to block hyperactivity in axenic larvae. These data show that microbial colonization during early life is required for normal neurobehavioral development and support the concept that antibiotics and other environmental chemicals may exert neurobehavioral effects via disruption of host-associated microbial communities.},

The stomach and colon have two layers of mucus; the inner layer is attached and the outer layer is less dense and unattached. In the colon, the outer mucus layer is the habitat for commensal bacteria. The inner mucus layer is impervious to bacteria and is renewed every hour by surface goblet cells. The crypt goblet cells have the ability to restitute the mucus layer by secretion, for example after an ischaemic challenge. Proteases of certain parasites and some bacteria can cleave mucins and dissolve the mucus as part of their pathogenicity. The inner mucus layer can, however, also become penetrable to bacteria by several other mechanisms, including aberrations in the immune system. When bacteria reach the epithelial surface, the immune system is activated and inflammation is triggered. This mechanism might occur in some types of ulcerative colitis.},

	abstract = {The mammalian intestine is colonized by a dense bacterial community, called microbiota. The microbiota shields from intestinal infection (colonization resistance). Recently, we have shown that enteropathogenic Salmonella spp. can exploit inflammation to compete with the intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms explaining the enhanced pathogen growth in the inflamed intestine are elusive. Here, we analysed the function of bacterial flagella in the inflamed intestine using a mouse model for acute Salmonella Typhimurium enterocolitis. Mutations affecting flagellar assembly (Fla-) and chemotaxis (Che-) impaired the pathogen's fitness in the inflamed intestine, but not in the normal gut. This was attributable to a localized source of high-energy nutrients (e.g. galactose-containing glyco-conjugates, mucin) released as an element of the mucosal defence. Motility allows Salmonella Typhimurium to benefit from these nutrients and utilize them for enhanced growth. Thus, nutrient availability contributes to enhanced pathogen growth in the inflamed intestine. Strategies interfering with bacterial motility or nutrient availability might offer starting points for therapeutic approaches. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

The flora forms a pool of numerous different antigens separated from mucosal immunocompetent cells by just a single layer of epithelial cells. Despite this thin barrier, however, the colonic mucosa is physiologically only mildly inflamed. This study looked at the mucosal humoral immune response against faecal anaerobes. By flow cytometric analysis the in vivo immunoglobulin coating of anaerobic bacteria in faecal samples of 22 healthy human volunteers was determined. In a previous study flow cytometric analysis of faecal bacteria has been found to be a very sensitive method to detect immunoglobulins on faecal bacteria. This technique showed that in vivo many bacteria are coated with IgA (24-74\%) and less with IgG and IgM. The presence of many bacteria coated with IgA implies that IgA coating does not result in permanent removal of the species from the colon. The absence of immunoglobulin coating suggests that there is immunological unresponsiveness for anaerobic bacterial antigens. It is concluded that both immunological unresponsiveness and preferential coating with IgA are responsible for the relative absence of colonic mucosal inflammation.},

However, the role of bacterial mobility in the penetration of viscous mucus and their spatial organization within the colon is relatively unknown. METHODS Movements of fecal bacteria were assessed in gels of varying agarose concentrations and were compared with patterns of bacterial distribution observed in colons from conventional and Enterobacter cloacae-monoassociated mice. Bacteria were visualized using fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS Long curly bacteria moved best in moderate viscosity gels, short rods and cocci preferred a low viscous environment, whereas high viscosity immobilized all bacterial groups. The spatial distribution of bacteria in the murine colon was also shape- and not taxonomy-dependent, indicating the existence of vertical (surface to lumen) and longitudinal (proximal to distal colon) viscosity gradients within the mucus layer. Our results suggest that mucus viscosity is low in goblet cells, at the crypt basis and close to the intestinal lumen, whereas sites adjacent to the columnar epithelium have a high mucus viscosity. The mucus viscosity increased progressively toward the distal colon, separating bacteria selectively in the proximal colon and completely in the distal colon. CONCLUSIONS The site-specific regulation of mucus secretion and dehydration make the mucus layer firm and impenetrable for bacteria in regions close to the intestinal mucosa but loose and lubricating in regions adjacent to the luminal contents. Selective control of mucus secretion and dehydration may prove to be a key factor in the management of chronic diseases in which intestinal pathogens are involved.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.01579},
	abstract = {Bacterial flagella mediate host–microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization, as well as by activating immune responses. The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including several human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, this unusual structural feature has remained an enigma. Here we demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist Vibrio fischeri and the pathogen Vibrio cholerae promotes release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide, found in the flagellar sheath. We further present a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. Such an observation not only has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, but also raises important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function.While a few of the bacteria that live in and on the bodies of humans and other animals are harmful and can cause disease, most others can offer benefits to their hosts. Many bacteria—including some important human pathogens—have tails called flagella that rotate to move the bacteria inside its host. However, the immune system can detect parts of these flagella and eliminate the pathogen.Bacterial flagella are made from filaments of proteins, and some flagella are also enclosed by a sheath that is similar to the outer membrane that encloses certain bacteria. The function of this sheath is unclear, although some researchers have suggested that it might prevent the immune system from detecting the proteins in the flagellum. Now, by studying the interactions between the Hawaiian bobtail squid and a marine bacterium, Brennan et al. show that the sheath can actually alert the host that the bacteria are around.The Hawaiian bobtail squid collects bioluminescent bacteria within a so-called ‘light organ'. This organ undergoes a number of developmental changes to house the bacteria, and the squid then uses the light from the bacteria to mask its own shadow, which helps it to avoid being detected by predators. Brennan et al. compared how wild-type bacteria and mutant bacteria that either had no flagella, or had flagella that did not rotate, interacted with young squid. Only bacteria with working flagella were able to trigger the normal development of the squid's light organ, which suggests that the rotating flagella are releasing the signal that tells the squid that the beneficial bacteria are present.Brennan et al. demonstrated that the rotation of sheathed flagella led to the release of a molecule called lipopolysaccharide. This molecule is known to activate the immune system in animals, and it is one of the bacterial signals that the squid responds to. Moreover, when the flagella of other bacteria with sheaths—such as those that cause cholera—are rotating, there is also an increase in the release of lipopolysaccharide. However, rotation of the flagella of bacteria without sheaths has no such effect. The next challenge will be to test the importance of this release of lipopolysaccharide from rotating flagella on the outcome of bacterial diseases of humans and other animals.},

	abstract = {Colonic epithelial cells are covered by thick inner and outer mucus layers. The inner mucus layer is free of commensal microbiota, which contributes to the maintenance of gut homeostasis. In the small intestine, molecules critical for prevention of bacterial invasion into epithelia such as Paneth-cell-derived anti-microbial peptides and regenerating islet-derived 3 (RegIII) family proteins have been identified. Although there are mucus layers providing physical barriers against the large number of microbiota present in the large intestine, the mechanisms that separate bacteria and colonic epithelia are not fully elucidated. Here we show that Ly6/PLAUR domain containing 8 (Lypd8) protein prevents flagellated microbiota invading the colonic epithelia in mice. Lypd8, selectively expressed in epithelial cells at the uppermost layer of the large intestinal gland, was secreted into the lumen and bound flagellated bacteria including Proteus mirabilis. In the absence of Lypd8, bacteria were present in the inner mucus layer and many flagellated bacteria invaded epithelia. Lypd8(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Antibiotic elimination of Gram-negative flagellated bacteria restored the bacterial-free state of the inner mucus layer and ameliorated DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in Lypd8(-/-) mice. Lypd8 bound to flagella and suppressed motility of flagellated bacteria. Thus, Lypd8 mediates segregation of intestinal bacteria and epithelial cells in the colon to preserve intestinal homeostasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The zebrafish intestine is a simple tapered tube that is folded into three sections. However, whether the intestine is functionally similar along its length remains unknown. Thus, a systematic structural and functional characterization of the zebrafish intestine is desirable for future studies of the digestive tract and the intestinal biology and development. RESULTS To characterize the structure and function of the adult zebrafish intestine, we divided the intestine into seven roughly equal-length segments, S1-S7, and systematically examined the morphology of the mucosal lining, histology of the epithelium, and molecular signatures from transcriptome analysis. Prominent morphological features are circumferentially-oriented villar ridges in segments S1-S6 and the absence of crypts. Molecular characterization of the transcriptome from each segment shows that segments S1-S5 are very similar while S6 and S7 unique. Gene ontology analyses reveal that S1-S5 express genes whose functions involve metabolism of carbohydrates, transport of lipids and energy generation, while the last two segments display relatively limited function. Based on comparative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, the first five segments share strong similarity with human and mouse small intestine while S6 shows similarity with human cecum and rectum, and S7 with human rectum. The intestinal tract does not display the anatomical, morphological, and molecular signatures of a stomach and thus we conclude that this organ is absent from the zebrafish digestive system. CONCLUSIONS Our genome-wide gene expression data indicate that, despite the lack of crypts, the rostral, mid, and caudal portions of the zebrafish intestine have distinct functions analogous to the mammalian small and large intestine, respectively. Organization of ridge structures represents a unique feature of zebrafish intestine, though they produce similar cross sections to mammalian intestines. Evolutionary lack of stomach, crypts, Paneth cells and submucosal glands has shaped the zebrafish intestine into a simpler but unique organ in vertebrate intestinal biology.},

	abstract = {Correlating the presence of bacteria and the genes they carry with aspects of plant and animal biology is rapidly outpacing the functional characterization of naturally occurring symbioses. A major barrier to mechanistic studies is the lack of tools for the efficient genetic manipulation of wild and diverse bacterial isolates. To address the need for improved molecular tools, we used a collection of proteobacterial isolates native to the zebrafish intestinal microbiota as a testbed to construct a series of modernized vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knockout procedures across lineages. The innovations that we introduce enhance the flexibility of conventional genetic techniques, making it easier to manipulate many different bacterial isolates with a single set of tools. We developed alternative strategies for domestication-free conjugation, designed plasmids with customizable features, and streamlined allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. We demonstrate the potential of these tools through a comparative study of bacterial behavior within the zebrafish intestine. Live imaging of fluorescently tagged isolates revealed a spectrum of distinct population structures that differ in their biogeography and dominant growth mode (i.e., planktonic versus aggregated). Most striking, we observed divergent genotype-phenotype relationships: several isolates that are predicted by genomic analysis and in vitro assays to be capable of flagellar motility do not display this trait within living hosts. Together, the tools generated in this work provide a new resource for the functional characterization of wild and diverse bacterial lineages that will help speed the research pipeline from sequencing-based correlations to mechanistic underpinnings. IMPORTANCE A great challenge in microbiota research is the immense diversity of symbiotic bacteria with the capacity to impact the lives of plants and animals. Moving beyond correlative DNA sequencing-based studies to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which symbiotic bacteria influence the biology of their hosts is stalling because genetic manipulation of new and uncharacterized bacterial isolates remains slow and difficult with current genetic tools. Moreover, developing tools de novo is an arduous and time-consuming task and thus represents a significant barrier to progress. To address this problem, we developed a suite of engineering vectors that streamline conventional genetic techniques by improving postcon-jugation counterselection, modularity, and allelic exchange. Our modernized tools and step-by-step protocols will empower researchers to investigate the inner workings of both established and newly emerging models of bacterial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {A bacterial pathogen is a highly adapted microorganism which has the capacity to cause disease. The mechanisms used by pathogenic bacteria to cause infection and disease usually include an interactive group of virulence determinants, sometimes coregulated, which are suited for the interaction of a particular microorganism with a specific host. Because pathogens must overcome similar host barriers, common themes in microbial pathogenesis have evolved. However, these mechanisms are diverse between species and not necessarily conserved; instead, convergent evolution has developed several different mechanisms to overcome host barriers. The success of a bacterial pathogen can be measured by the degree with which it replicates after entering the host and reaching its specific niche. Successful microbial infection reflects persistence within a host and avoidance or neutralization of the specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms of the host. The degree of success of a pathogen is dependent upon the status of the host. As pathogens pass through a host, they are exposed to new environments. Highly adapted pathogenic organisms have developed biochemical sensors exquisitely designed to measure and respond to such environmental stimuli and accordingly to regulate a cascade of virulence determinants essential for life within the host. The pathogenic state is the product of dynamic selective pressures on microbial populations.},

	abstract = {The vast numbers of microbes that reside in the intestines of humans and other animals influence normal physiological functions and, when perturbed, can contribute to many disorders. Antibiotics can dramatically alter gut communities, even at concentrations far below lethal doses, for reasons that remain unclear. We directly imaged native bacterial species inside living larval zebrafish as they reacted to low concentrations of the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin. We found that antibiotics enhanced aggregation of live bacterial cells, resulting in their increased expulsion from the gut by the intestine's mechanical contractions. Our observations and biophysical model suggest that gut bacterial populations may be especially sensitive to environmental antibiotic contamination, as cell-scale responses are amplified by the material transport characteristic of gastrointestinal systems. Antibiotics induce large and highly variable changes in the intestinal microbiome even at sublethal concentrations, through mechanisms that remain elusive. Using gnotobiotic zebrafish, which allow high-resolution examination of microbial dynamics, we found that sublethal doses of the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin cause severe drops in bacterial abundance. Contrary to conventional views of antimicrobial tolerance, disruption was more pronounced for slow-growing, aggregated bacteria than for fast-growing, planktonic species. Live imaging revealed that antibiotic treatment promoted bacterial aggregation and increased susceptibility to intestinal expulsion. Intestinal mechanics therefore amplify the effects of antibiotics on resident bacteria. Microbial dynamics are captured by a biophysical model that connects antibiotic-induced collapses to gelation phase transitions in soft materials, providing a framework for predicting the impact of antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome.},

To date, most investigations aimed at identifying traits required for host association have focused on intrahost niches. Consequently, little is known about the relative contribution of extrahost factors such as environmental growth and survival and immigration into hosts from the external environment, as promoters of host association. To address this, we developed a tractable experimental evolution system that investigates both intra- and extrahost factors contributing to bacterial adaptation to the vertebrate gut. We passaged replicate lines of a zebrafish bacterial isolate, Aeromonas veronii, through populations of germ-free larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), each time using gut-associated Aeromonas populations to inoculate the aquatic environment of the next zebrafish population. We observed rapid increased adaptation to the host in all replicate lines. The initial adaptations present in early-evolved isolates did not increase intrahost fitness but rather enhanced both immigration from the environment and interhost transmission. Only in later-evolved isolates did we find evidence for intrahost-specific adaptations, as demonstrated by comparing their competitive fitness in the host genotype to which they evolved to that in a different genotype. Our results show how selection for bacterial transmission between hosts and their environment can shape bacterial-host association. This work illuminates the nature of selective forces present in host-microbe systems and reveals specific mechanisms of increased host association. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the entire host-microbe-environment system must be considered when identifying microbial traits that contribute to host adaptation.},

In mutants of diverse bacteria lacking the chemotaxis response, migration in classic motility agar, which constitutes a fluid-filled porous medium, is compromised; straight-swimming cells unable to tumble become trapped within the agar matrix. Spontaneous mutations that restore spreading have been previously observed in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli, and recent work in other bacterial species has isolated and quantified different classes of nonchemotacting mutants exhibiting the same spreading phenotype. We present a theoretical description of bacterial diffusion in a porous medium - the natural habitat for many cell types - which elucidates how diverse modifications of the motility apparatus resulting in a nonzero tumbling frequency allows for unjamming of otherwise straight-swimming cells at internal boundaries and leads to net migration. A unique result of our analysis is increasing diffusive spread with increasing tumbling frequency in the small pore limit, consistent with earlier experimental observations but not captured by previous models. Our theoretical results, combined with a simple model of bacterial diffusion and growth in agar, are compared with our experimental measurements of swim ring expansion as a function of time, demonstrating good quantitative agreement. Our results suggest that the details of the cellular tumbling process may be adapted to enable bacteria to propagate efficiently through complex environments. For engineered, self-propelled microswimmers that navigate via alternating straight runs and changes in direction, these results suggest an optimal reorientation strategy for efficient migration in a porous environment with a given microarchitecture.},

Little is known about how colonic transit time relates to human colonic metabolism and its importance for host health, although a firm stool consistency, a proxy for a long colonic transit time, has recently been positively associated with gut microbial richness. Here, we show that colonic transit time in humans, assessed using radio-opaque markers, is associated with overall gut microbial composition, diversity and metabolism. We find that a long colonic transit time associates with high microbial richness and is accompanied by a shift in colonic metabolism from carbohydrate fermentation to protein catabolism as reflected by higher urinary levels of potentially deleterious protein-derived metabolites. Additionally, shorter colonic transit time correlates with metabolites possibly reflecting increased renewal of the colonic mucosa. Together, this suggests that a high gut microbial richness does not per se imply a healthy gut microbial ecosystem and points at colonic transit time as a highly important factor to consider in microbiome and metabolomics studies.},

	abstract = {Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can cross the epithelial barrier using either the invasion-associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) or a T3SS-1-independent mechanism that remains poorly characterized. Here we show that flagellum-mediated motility supported a T3SS-1-independent pathway for entering ileal Peyer's patches in the mouse model. Flagellum-dependent invasion of Peyer's patches required energy taxis toward nitrate, which was mediated by the methylaccepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) Tsr. Generation of nitrate in the intestinal lumen required inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which was synthesized constitutively in the mucosa of the terminal ileum but not in the jejunum, duodenum, or cecum. Tsr-mediated invasion of ileal Peyer's patches was abrogated in mice deficient for Nos2, the gene encoding iNOS. We conclude that Tsr-mediated energy taxis enables S. Typhimurium to migrate toward the intestinal epithelium by sensing host-derived nitrate, thereby contributing to invasion of Peyer's patches. IMPORTANCE Nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars, such as S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, are a common cause of gastroenteritis in immunocompetent individuals but can also cause bacteremia in immunocompromised individuals. While the invasion-associated type III secretion system (T3SS-1) is important for entry, S. Typhimurium strains lacking a functional T3SS-1 can still cross the intestinal epithelium and cause a disseminated lethal infection in mice. Here we observed that flagellum-mediated motility and chemotaxis contributed to a T3SS-1-independent pathway for invasion and systemic dissemination to the spleen. This pathway required the methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) Tsr and energy taxis toward hostderived nitrate, which we found to be generated by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the ileal mucosa prior to infection. Collectively, our data suggest that S. Typhimurium enhances invasion by actively migrating toward the intestinal epithelium along a gradient of host-derived nitrate emanating from the mucosal surface of the ileum.},

	abstract = {The mammalian intestine harbors a complex microbial community that provides numerous benefits to its host. However, the microbiota can also include potentially virulent species, termed pathobiont, which can cause disease when intestinal homeostasis is disrupted. The molecular mechanisms by which pathobionts cause disease remain poorly understood. Here we describe a sepsis-like disease that occurs upon gut injury in antibiotic-treated mice. Sepsis was associated with the systemic spread of a specific multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli pathobiont that expanded markedly in the microbiota of antibiotic-treated mice. Rapid sepsis-like death required a component of the innate immune system, the Naip5-Nlrc4 inflammasome. In accordance with Koch's postulates, we found the E. coli pathobiont was sufficient to activate Naip5-Nlrc4 and cause disease when injected intravenously into unmanipulated mice. These findings reveal how sepsis-like disease can result from recognition of pathobionts by the innate immune system. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Each group included 20 subjects. Ten patients who had IBD and who were being treated with antibiotics were also studied. Use of nonaqueous Carnoy fixative to preserve the mucus layer was crucial for detection of bacteria adherent to the mucosal surface (mucosal bacteria). No biofilm was detectable in formalin-fixed biopsy specimens. Mucosal bacteria were found at concentrations greater than 10(9)/ml in 90 to 95\% of IBD patients, 95\% of patients with self-limiting colitis, 65\% of IBS patients, and 35\% of healthy controls. The mean density of the mucosal biofilm was 2 powers higher in IBD patients than in patients with IBS or controls, and bacteria were mostly adherent.

In patients treated with (5-ASA) or antibiotics, the biofilm could be detected with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole but did not hybridize with fluorescence in situ hybridization probes. A Bacteroides fragilis biofilm is the main feature of IBD. This was not previously recognized due to a lack of appropriate tissue fixation.

Gnotobiology, the study of biological systems in which all members are known, enables precise experimental analysis of the necessity and sufficiency of microbes in animal biology by deriving animals germ-free (GF) and inoculating them with defined microbial lineages. Mammalian host models have long dominated gnotobiology, but we have recently adapted gnotobiotic approaches to the zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important aquatic model. Zebrafish offer several experimental attributes that enable rapid, large-scale gnotobiotic experimentation with high replication rates and exquisite optical resolution. Here we describe detailed protocols for three procedures that form the foundation of zebrafish gnotobiology: derivation of GF embryos, microbial association of GF animals, and long-term, GF husbandry.

	abstract = {Are there general biophysical relationships governing the spatial organization of the gut microbiome? Despite growing realization that spatial structure is important for population stability, interbacterial competition, and host functions, it is unclear in any animal gut whether such structure is subject to predictive, unifying rules or if it results from contextual, species-specific behaviors. To explore this, we used light sheet fluorescence microscopy to conduct a high-resolution comparative study of bacterial distribution patterns throughout the entire intestinal volume of live, larval zebrafish. Fluorescently tagged strains of seven bacterial symbionts, representing six different species native to zebrafish, were each separately monoassociated with animals that had been raised initially germ-free. The strains showed large differences in both cohesion-the degree to which they auto-aggregate-and spatial distribution. We uncovered a striking correlation between each strain's mean position and its cohesion, whether quantified as the fraction of cells existing as planktonic individuals, the average aggregate size, or the total number of aggregates. Moreover, these correlations held within species as well; aggregates of different sizes localized as predicted from the pan-species observations. Together, our findings indicate that bacteria within the zebrafish intestine are subject to generic processes that organize populations by their cohesive properties. The likely drivers of this relationship-peristaltic fluid flow, tubular anatomy, and bacterial growth and aggregation kinetics-are common throughout animals. We therefore suggest that the framework introduced here of biophysical links between bacterial cohesion and spatial organization should be useful for directing explorations in other host-microbe systems, formulating detailed models that can quantitatively map onto experimental data, and developing new tools that manipulate cohesion to engineer microbiome function.},

To remove this roadblock, a macrophage-specific marker was identified (mpeg1) and its promoter used in mpeg1-driven transgenes. mpeg1-driven transgenes are expressed in macrophage-lineage cells that do not express neutrophil-marking transgenes. Using these lines, the different dynamic behaviors of neutrophils and macrophages after wounding were compared side-by-side in compound transgenics.

The host's innate immune system and a complex set of Salmonella virulence factors are thought to contribute to enteric disease. The serovar Typhimurium virulence factors have been studied extensively by using tissue culture assays, and bovine infection models have been used to verify the role of these factors in enterocolitis. Streptomycin-pretreated mice provide an alternative animal model to study enteric salmonellosis. In this model, the Salmonella pathogenicity island I type III secretion system has a key virulence function. Nothing is known about the role of other virulence factors. We investigated the role of flagella in murine serovar Typhimurium colitis. A nonflagellated serovar Typhimurium mutant (fliGHI) efficiently colonized the intestine but caused little colitis during the early phase of infection (10 and 24 h postinfection). In competition assays with differentially labeled strains, the fliGHI mutant had a reduced capacity to get near the intestinal epithelium, as determined by fluorescence microscopy. A flagellated but nonchemotactic cheY mutant had the same virulence defects as the fliGHI mutant for causing colitis. In competitive infections, both mutants colonized the intestine of streptomycin-pretreated mice by day 1 postinfection but were outcompeted by the wild-type strain by day 3 postinfection. Together, these data demonstrate that flagella are required for efficient colonization and induction of colitis in streptomycin-pretreated mice. This effect is mostly attributable to chemotaxis.

	abstract = {UNLABELLED Using the squid-vibrio association, we aimed to characterize the mechanism through which Vibrio fischeri cells signal morphogenesis of the symbiotic light-emitting organ. The symbiont releases two cell envelope molecules, peptidoglycan (PG) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that, within 12 h of light organ colonization, act in synergy to trigger normal tissue development. Recent work has shown that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) produced by V. fischeri are sufficient to induce PG-dependent morphogenesis; however, the mechanism(s) of OMV release by these bacteria has not been described. Like several genera of both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, V. fischeri cells elaborate polar flagella that are enclosed by an extension of the outer membrane, whose function remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that along with the well-recognized phenomenon of blebbing from the cell's surface, rotation of this sheathed flagellum also results in the release of OMVs. In addition, we demonstrate that most of the development-inducing LPS is associated with these OMVs and that the presence of the outer membrane protein OmpU but not the LPS O antigen on these OMVs is important in triggering normal host development. These results also present insights into a possible new mechanism of LPS release by pathogens with sheathed flagella. IMPORTANCE Determining the function(s) of sheathed flagella in bacteria has been challenging, because no known mutation results only in the loss of this outer membrane-derived casing. Nevertheless, the presence of a sheathed flagellum in such host-associated genera as Vibrio, Helicobacter, and Brucella has led to several proposed functions, including physical protection of the flagella and masking of their immunogenic flagellins. Using the squid-vibrio light organ symbiosis, we demonstrate another role, that of V. fischeri cells require rotating flagella to induce apoptotic cell death within surface epithelium, which is a normal step in the organ's development. Further, we present evidence that this rotation releases apoptosis-triggering lipopolysaccharide in the form of outer membrane vesicles. Such release may also occur by pathogens but with different outcomes for the host.},

	abstract = {A balanced gut microbiota is important for human health, but the mechanisms that maintain homeostasis are incompletely understood. Recent insights suggest the host plays a key role in shaping its gut microbiota to be beneficial. While host control in the small intestine curbs bacterial numbers to avoid competition for simple sugars and amino acids, the host limits oxygen availability in the large intestine to obtain microbial fermentation products from fiber. Epithelial cells are major players in imposing ecological control mechanisms, which involves the release of antimicrobial peptides by small-intestinal Paneth cells and maintenance of luminal anaerobiosis by epithelial hypoxia in the colon. Harnessing these epithelial control mechanisms for therapeutic means could provide a novel lynchpin for strategies to remediate dysbiosis.},

Here we used cDNA microarray expression profiling to define the molecular determinants that mediate such changes in model intestinal epithelia. Enteropathogenic Salmonella induced a classical proinflammatory gene expression program similar to that activated by the canonical proinflammatory agonist TNF-alpha. Nonproinflammatory bacteria, both commensals (Escherichia coli) and systemic pathogens (S. typhi), did not activate this expression profile. While S. typhimurium strains lacking the SPI-1-encoded type III system were fully proinflammatory, strains lacking the genes for the flagellar structural component flagellin were nearly devoid of proinflammatory signaling. Lastly, the epithelial proinflammatory response could be largely recapitulated by basolateral addition of purified flagellin. Thus, S. typhimurium flagellin is the major molecular trigger by which this pathogen activates gut epithelial proinflammatory gene expression.},

We use an established computational, individual-based model to study the impact of host factors that regulate adhesion at the epithelial surface. Our simulations predict that host-mediated adhesion can increase the competitive advantage of microbes and create ecological refugia for slow-growing species. We show how positive selection via adhesion can be transformed into negative selection if the host secretes large quantities of a matrix such as mucus. Our work predicts that adhesion is a powerful mechanism for both positive and negative selection within the microbiota. We discuss molecules - mucus glycans and IgA - that affect microbe adhesion and identify testable predictions of the adhesion-as-selection model.},

	abstract = {The intestinal epithelium serves critical physiologic functions that are shared among all vertebrates. However, it is unknown how the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying these functions have changed over the course of vertebrate evolution. We generated genome-wide mRNA and accessible chromatin data from adult intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in zebrafish, stickleback, mouse, and human species to determine if conserved IEC functions are achieved through common transcriptional regulation. We found evidence for substantial common regulation and conservation of gene expression regionally along the length of the intestine from fish to mammals and identified a core set of genes comprising a vertebrate IEC signature. We also identified transcriptional start sites and other putative regulatory regions that are differentially accessible in IECs in all 4 species. Although these sites rarely showed sequence conservation from fish to mammals, surprisingly, they drove highly conserved IEC expression in a zebrafish reporter assay. Common putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) found at these sites in multiple species indicate that sequence conservation alone is insufficient to identify much of the functionally conserved IEC regulatory information. Among the rare, highly sequence-conserved, IEC-specific regulatory regions, we discovered an ancient enhancer upstream from her6/HES1 that is active in a distinct population of Notch-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium. Together, these results show how combining accessible chromatin and mRNA datasets with TFBS prediction and in vivo reporter assays can reveal tissue-specific regulatory information conserved across 420 million years of vertebrate evolution. We define an IEC transcriptional regulatory network that is shared between fish and mammals and establish an experimental platform for studying how evolutionarily distilled regulatory information commonly controls IEC development and physiology.},

During the process of clearing infections, the immune system often causes considerable tissue damage. Conversely, if the target of immunity is a member of the resident microbiota, uncontrolled inflammation may lead to host pathology in the absence of infectious agents. Recent evidence suggests that several inflammatory disorders may be caused by specific bacterial species found in most healthy hosts. Although the mechanisms that mediate pathology remain largely unclear, it appears that genetic defects and/or environmental factors may predispose mammals to immune-mediated diseases triggered by potentially pathogenic symbionts of the microbiota. We have termed this class of microbes 'pathobionts', to distinguish them from acquired infectious agents.

The ranking of the promoter activities was somewhat different when assayed in Escherichia coli, but the promoters are efficient for modulating gene expression in this bacterium as well. DNA sequencing revealed that the weaker promoters (which had activities below 5 relative units) all had changes either in the consensus sequences or in the length of the spacer between the -35 and -10 sequences. The promoters in which those features were conserved had activities from 5 to 2,050 U, which shows that by randomizing the spacers, at least a 400-fold change in activity can be obtained. Interestingly, the entire range of promoter activities is covered in small steps of activity increase, which makes these promoters very suitable for quantitative physiological studies and for fine-tuning of gene expression in industrial bioreactors and cell factories.},

A decade of genome-wide association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota.

Enhanced technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level.

Environmental temperature plays an important role in the immune system and infection progression of ectotherms. In this study, we analyzed the impact of short-term heat shock on neutrophil function using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as an animal model. Short-term heat shock decreased neutrophil recruitment to localized Streptococcus iniae infection and tail fin wounding. Heat shock also increased random neutrophil motility transiently and increased the number of circulating neutrophils. With the use of the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) method for RNA isolation from specific cell types such as neutrophils, macrophages and epithelial cells, we found that heat shock induced the immediate expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and a prolonged expression of heat shock protein 27 (hsp27). Heat shock also induced cell stress as detected by the splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (xbp1) mRNA, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Exogenous expression of Hsp70, Hsp27 and spliced Xbp1 in neutrophils or epithelial cells did not reproduce the heat shock induced effects on neutrophil recruitment. The effect of heat shock on neutrophils is likely due to a combination of complex changes, including, but not limited to changes in gene expression. Our results indicate that routine heat shock can alter neutrophil function in zebrafish. The findings suggest that caution should be taken when employing a heat shock-dependent inducible system to study the innate immune response.},

Most of our knowledge of the processes required for V. cholerae intestinal colonization is derived from enumeration of wt and mutant V. cholerae recovered from orogastrically infected infant mice. There is limited knowledge of the distribution of V. cholerae within the SI, particularly its localization along the villous axis, or of the bacterial and host factors that account for this distribution. Here, using confocal and intravital two-photon microscopy to monitor the localization of fluorescently tagged V. cholerae strains, we uncovered unexpected and previously unrecognized features of V. cholerae intestinal colonization. Direct visualization of the pathogen within the intestine revealed that the majority of V. cholerae microcolonies attached to the intestinal epithelium arise from single cells, and that there are notable regiospecific aspects to V. cholerae localization and factors required for colonization. In the proximal SI, V. cholerae reside exclusively within the developing intestinal crypts, but they are not restricted to the crypts in the more distal SI. Unexpectedly, V. cholerae motility proved to be a regiospecific colonization factor that is critical for colonization of the proximal, but not the distal, SI. Furthermore, neither motility nor chemotaxis were required for proper V. cholerae distribution along the villous axis or in crypts, suggesting that yet undefined processes enable the pathogen to find its niches outside the intestinal lumen. Finally, our observations suggest that host mucins are a key factor limiting V. cholerae intestinal colonization, particularly in the proximal SI where there appears to be a more abundant mucus layer. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the potent capacity of direct pathogen visualization during infection to deepen our understanding of host pathogen interactions.},

This is a channel with an array of membrane valves along its length, which allows mimicking active contractions of the colonic wall. Repeated contraction is shown to be crucial in maintaining a steady-state bacterial population in the device despite strong flow along the channel that would otherwise cause bacterial washout. Depending on the flow rate and the frequency of contractions, the bacterial density profile exhibits varying spatial dependencies. For a synthetic cross-feeding community, the species abundance ratio is also strongly affected by mixing and flow along the length of the device. Complex mixing dynamics due to contractions is described well by an effective diffusion term. Bacterial dynamics is captured by a simple reaction-diffusion model without adjustable parameters. Our results suggest that flow and mixing play a major role in shaping the microbiota of the colon.},

	abstract = {abstract: One aspect of community ecology that has been given particular attention is the pattern of species abundances in a community. The species may have a wide range of abundances; some are very common and others rare. When species abundance models are fitted to observations, the lognormal model and one of the gamma models (e.g., the log‐series model) are usually applied. The model that gives the best fit according to some goodness‐of‐fit test is then chosen. By applying a diffusion approximation for each species' dynamics with density regulation of the θ‐logistic type, we here present a general species abundance model that embraces the two most widely applied species abundance models, the lognormal and the gamma. Our general model will, therefore, provide a better fit than the two special cases, except when it corresponds to one of them. In contrast to the classical models, ours is also dynamic, making it possible to evaluate the fluctuations in species abundance over time through both biotic and abiotic factors. The model is fitted to several species abundance data sets and our results compared to previous attempts to fit a model, usually either the lognormal or the log‐series.},

	abstract = {The high-fat, high-calorie diets of westernized cultures contribute to the global obesity epidemic, and early life exposure to antibiotics may potentiate those dietary effects. Previous experiments with mice had shown that sub-therapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)—even restricted to early life—affected the gut microbiota, altered host metabolism, and increased adiposity throughout the lifetime of the animals. Here we carried out a large-scale cohousing experiment to investigate whether cohousing STAT and untreated (Control) mice would transfer the STAT-perturbed microbiota and transmit its impact on weight. We exposed pregnant dams and their young offspring to either low-dose penicillin (STAT) or water (Control) until weaning, and then followed the offspring as they grew and endured a switch from normal to high-fat diet at week 17 of life. Cohousing, which started at week 4, rapidly approximated the microbiota within cages, lowering the weight of STAT mice relative to non-cohoused mice. The effect, however, varied between cages, and was restricted to the first 16 weeks when diet consisted of normal chow. Once mice switched to high-fat diet, the microbiota α- and β-diversity expanded and the effect of cohousing faded: STAT mice, again, were heavier than control mice independently of cohousing. Metabolomics revealed serum metabolites associated with STAT exposure, but no significant differences were detected in glucose or insulin tolerance. Our results show that cohousing can partly ameliorate the impact of STAT on the gut microbiota but not prevent increased weight with high-fat diet. These observations have implications for microbiota therapies aimed to resolve the collateral damage of antibiotics and their load on human obesity.},

	abstract = {The ecology of microbes in the gut has been shown to play important roles in the health of the host. To better understand microbial growth and population dynamics in the proximal colon, the primary region of bacterial growth in the gut, we built and applied a fluidic channel that we call the "minigut." This is a channel with an array of membrane valves along its length, which allows mimicking active contractions of the colonic wall. Repeated contraction is shown to be crucial in maintaining a steady-state bacterial population in the device despite strong flow along the channel that would otherwise cause bacterial washout. Depending on the flow rate and the frequency of contractions, the bacterial density profile exhibits varying spatial dependencies. For a synthetic cross-feeding community, the species abundance ratio is also strongly affected by mixing and flow along the length of the device. Complex mixing dynamics due to contractions is described well by an effective diffusion term. Bacterial dynamics is captured by a simple reaction-diffusion model without adjustable parameters. Our results suggest that flow and mixing play a major role in shaping the microbiota of the colon.},

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

Enabled by new DNA sequencing technologies, there is a burgeoning interest in animal–microbiota interactions, but dissecting the specific impacts of microbes on their hosts is experimentally challenging. Gnotobiology, the study of biological systems in which all members are known, enables precise experimental analysis of the necessity and sufficiency of microbes in animal biology by deriving animals germ-free (GF) and inoculating them with defined microbial lineages. Mammalian host models have long dominated gnotobiology, but we have recently adapted gnotobiotic approaches to the zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important aquatic model. Zebrafish offer several experimental attributes that enable rapid, large-scale gnotobiotic experimentation with high replication rates and exquisite optical resolution. Here we describe detailed protocols for three procedures that form the foundation of zebrafish gnotobiology: derivation of GF embryos, microbial association of GF animals, and long-term, GF husbandry. Our aim is to provide sufficient guidance in zebrafish gnotobiotic methodology to expand and enrich this exciting field of research.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiota is a complex consortium of microorganisms with the ability to influence important aspects of host health and development. Harnessing this "microbial organ" for biomedical applications requires clarifying the degree to which host and bacterial factors act alone or in combination to govern the stability of specific lineages. To address this issue, we combined bacteriological manipulation and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to monitor the dynamics of a defined two-species microbiota within a vertebrate gut. We observed that the interplay between each population and the gut environment produces distinct spatiotemporal patterns. As a consequence, one species dominates while the other experiences sudden drops in abundance that are well fit by a stochastic mathematical model. Modeling revealed that direct bacterial competition could only partially explain the observed phenomena, suggesting that a host factor is also important in shaping the community. We hypothesized the host determinant to be gut motility, and tested this mechanism by measuring colonization in hosts with enteric nervous system dysfunction due to a mutation in the ret locus, which in humans is associated with the intestinal motility disorder known as Hirschsprung disease. In mutant hosts we found reduced gut motility and, confirming our hypothesis, robust coexistence of both bacterial species. This study provides evidence that host-mediated spatial structuring and stochastic perturbation of communities can drive bacterial population dynamics within the gut, and it reveals a new facet of the intestinal host-microbe interface by demonstrating the capacity of the enteric nervous system to influence the microbiota. Ultimately, these findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting the intestinal ecosystem should consider the dynamic physical nature of the gut environment.},

Microbial community shifts were apparent during periods of constant diet and environmental conditions, as well as in concert with dietary and environmental change. Interindividual variation in the intestinal microbiota increased with age, as did the difference between the intestinal microbiota and microbes in the surrounding environment.

The gut microbiota of fish monocolonized by symbiotic strain Aeromonas veronii was displaced by V. cholerae expressing its type VI secretion system (T6SS), a syringe-like apparatus that deploys effector proteins into target cells. Surprisingly, displacement was independent of T6SS-mediated killing of A. veronii, driven instead by T6SS-induced enhancement of zebrafish intestinal movements that led to expulsion of the resident microbiota by the host. Deleting an actin cross-linking domain from the T6SS apparatus returned intestinal motility to normal and thwarted expulsion, without weakening V. cholerae's ability to kill A. veronii in vitro.

The zebrafish intestine is regionalized and the various segments can be identified by epithelial markers whose expression is already segregated at the onset of intestinal differentiation. Differentiation of cells derived from the three primary germ layers begins more or less contemporaneously, and is preceded by a stage in which there is rapid cell proliferation and maturation of epithelial cell polarization.

	abstract = {Acquisition of the intestinal microbiota begins at birth, and a stable microbial community develops from a succession of key organisms. Disruption of the microbiota during maturation by low-dose antibiotic exposure can alter host metabolism and adiposity. We now show that low-dose penicillin (LDP), delivered from birth, induces metabolic alterations and affects ileal expression of genes involved in immunity. LDP that is limited to early life transiently perturbs the microbiota, which is sufficient to induce sustained effects on body composition, indicating that microbiota interactions in infancy may be critical determinants of long-term host metabolic effects. In addition, LDP enhances the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity. The growth promotion phenotype is transferrable to germ-free hosts by LDP-selected microbiota, showing that the altered microbiota, not antibiotics per se, play a causal role. These studies characterize important variables in early-life microbe-host metabolic interaction and identify several taxa consistently linked with metabolic alterations.

Using the gnotobiotic zebrafish, we discovered that the normal expansion of the pancreatic β cell population during early larval development requires the intestinal microbiota and that specific bacterial members can restore normal β cell numbers. These bacteria share a gene that encodes a previously undescribed protein, named herein BefA (β Cell Expansion Factor A), which is sufficient to induce β cell proliferation in developing zebrafish larvae. Homologs of BefA are present in several human-associated bacterial species, and we show that they have conserved capacity to stimulate β cell proliferation in larval zebrafish. Our findings highlight a role for the microbiota in early pancreatic β cell development and suggest a possible basis for the association between low diversity childhood fecal microbiota and increased diabetes risk.},

We showed previously that the microbiota is required for allocation of appropriate numbers of secretory cells in the zebrafish intestinal epithelium. Because Notch signaling is crucial for secretory fate determination, we conducted epistasis experiments to establish whether the microbiota modulates host Notch signaling. We also investigated whether innate immune signaling transduces microbiota cues via the Myd88 adaptor protein. We provide the first evidence that microbiota-induced, Myd88-dependent signaling inhibits host Notch signaling in the intestinal epithelium, thereby promoting secretory cell fate determination. These results connect microbiota activity via innate immune signaling to the Notch pathway, which also plays crucial roles in intestinal homeostasis throughout life and when impaired can result in chronic inflammation and cancer.},

Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible.

Using an unbiased screening strategy, we found that zebrafish Hnf4a specifically binds and activates a microbiota-suppressed intestinal epithelial transcriptional enhancer. Genetic analysis revealed that zebrafish hnf4a activates nearly half of the genes that are suppressed by microbiota, suggesting microbiota negatively regulate Hnf4a. In support, analysis of genomic architecture in mouse intestinal epithelial cells disclosed that microbiota colonization leads to activation or inactivation of hundreds of enhancers along with drastic genome-wide reduction of HNF4A and HNF4G occupancy. Interspecies meta-analysis suggested interactions between HNF4A and microbiota promote gene expression patterns associated with human inflammatory bowel diseases. These results indicate a critical and conserved role for HNF4A in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in response to microbiota.},

These methods enable unprecedented studies of life at the microscale, but bring with them larger and more complex datasets. New image processing techniques are therefore called for to analyze the resulting images in an accurate and efficient manner. Convolutional neural networks are becoming the standard for classification of objects within images due to their accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional techniques. Their application to data derived from 3D imaging, however, is relatively new and has mostly been in areas of magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography. It remains unclear, for images of discrete cells in variable backgrounds as are commonly encountered in fluorescence microscopy, whether convolutional neural networks provide sufficient performance to warrant their adoption, especially given the challenges of human comprehension of their classification criteria and their requirements of large training datasets. We therefore applied a 3D convolutional neural network to distinguish bacteria and non-bacterial objects in 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy images of larval zebrafish intestines. We find that the neural network is as accurate as human experts, outperforms random forest and support vector machine classifiers, and generalizes well to a different bacterial species. We also discuss network design considerations, and describe the dependence of accuracy on dataset size and data augmentation. We provide source code and descriptions of our analysis pipeline to facilitate adoption of convolutional neural network analysis for three-dimensional microscopy data.},

Mammalian host models have long dominated gnotobiology, but we have recently adapted gnotobiotic approaches to the zebrafish (Danio rerio), an important aquatic model. Zebrafish offer several experimental attributes that enable rapid, large-scale gnotobiotic experimentation with high replication rates and exquisite optical resolution. Here we describe detailed protocols for three procedures that form the foundation of zebrafish gnotobiology: derivation of GF embryos, microbial association of GF animals, and long-term, GF husbandry.

We found that zebrafish lacking an ENS due to a mutation in the Hirschsprung disease gene, sox10, develop microbiota-dependent inflammation that is transmissible between hosts. Profiling microbial communities across a spectrum of inflammatory phenotypes revealed that increased levels of inflammation were linked to an overabundance of proinflammatory bacterial lineages and a lack of anti-inflammatory bacterial lineages. Moreover, either administering a representative anti-inflammatory strain or restoring ENS function corrected the pathology. Thus, we demonstrate that the ENS modulates gut microbiota community membership to maintain intestinal health.},

At 10 dpf, axenic zebrafish exhibited hyperactivity compared to conventionalized and conventionally colonized controls. Impairment of host colonization using antibiotics also caused hyperactivity in conventionally colonized larvae. To determine whether there is a developmental requirement for microbial colonization, axenic embryos were serially colonized on 1, 3, 6, or 9 dpf and evaluated on 10 dpf. Normal activity levels were observed in axenic larvae colonized on 1–6 dpf, but not on 9 dpf.

These interactions are thought to influence microbial succession, community stability, syntrophic relationships, and resiliency in the face of perturbations. The complexity and dynamism of the gut microbiota pose considerable challenges for quantitative analysis of its spatial organization. Here, we illustrate an approach for addressing this challenge, using (i) amodel, defined 15-member consortium of phylogenetically diverse, sequenced human gut bacterial strains introduced into adult gnotobioticmice fed a polysaccharide-rich diet, and (ii) in situ hybridization and spectral imaging analysis methods that allow simultaneous detection of multiple bacterial strains at multiple spatial scales. Differences in the binding affinities of strains for substrates such as mucus or food particles, combined with more rapid replication in a preferred microhabitat, could, in principle, lead to localized clonally expanded aggregates composed of one or a few taxa. However, our results reveal a colonic community that is mixed atmicrometer scales,with distinct spatial distributions of some taxa relative to one another, notably at the border between the mucosa and the lumen.Our data suggest that lumen and mucosa in the proximal colon should be conceptualized not as stratified compartments but as components of an incompletely mixed bioreactor. Employing the experimental approaches described should allowdirect tests of whether and how specified host and microbial factors influence the nature and functional contributions of “microscale” mixing to the dynamic operations of the microbiota in health and disease.},

	abstract = {Marine snow is a ubiquitous feature of the ocean and an important agent in the transport of energy and nutrients through marine ecosystems. Diatom aggregates, which form during blooms and, to a lesser extent, by the resuspension of benthic biofilms, are a primary source of marine snow. Genera commonly found in diatom aggregates are: Nitzschia, Chaetoceros, Rhizosolenia, Leptocylindricus, Skeletonema and Thalassionema. Most fieldwork has been restricted to a limited number of locations in the Northern Hemisphere. To quantify the global impact of diatom aggregation there is a need to conduct fieldwork in a wider range of areas, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Aggregates form when particles collide and stick together. Collisions in the water column are affected by turbulence, differential settlement and animal feeding, whereas diatom stickiness is affected by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that diatoms produce more EPS under nutrient limitation, although little is known about how limitation by different nutrients affects the quantity and composition of EPS and subsequent stickiness. EPS form three pools in the environment: cell coatings, soluble EPS and transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP). There is a need to investigate the dynamics of conversion between the pools of EPS by both abiotic and biological processes and how these conversions affect aggregate concentration and structure. Processes governing disaggregation have been largely overlooked, although they are as important as aggregation in determining the dynamics of aggregate concentrations in the water column. The biogeochemical significance of diatom aggregates as a means of transporting carbon and other nutrients from the euphotic zone to the seabed is well established. However, the internal biogeochemistry of aggregates is not well understood. Aggregates contain anaerobic microsites and further work is required to establish whether aggregates are significant sinks for nitrogen in the water column through anaerobic denitrification. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain diatom aggregation in the field, but many of these are flawed because the mechanisms and adaptive explanations proposed require natural selection to operate at the level of populations rather than genes or individuals},

We developed a zebrafish model and used live imaging to directly study how the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae invades the intestine. The gut microbiota of fish monocolonized by symbiotic strain Aeromonas veronii was displaced by V. cholerae expressing its type VI secretion system (T6SS), a syringe-like apparatus that deploys effector proteins into target cells. Surprisingly, displacement was independent of T6SS-mediated killing of A. veronii, driven instead by T6SS-induced enhancement of zebrafish intestinal movements that led to expulsion of the resident microbiota by the host. Deleting an actin cross-linking domain from the T6SS apparatus returned intestinal motility to normal and thwarted expulsion, without weakening V. cholerae's ability to kill A. veronii in vitro. Our finding that bacteria can manipulate host physiology to influence intermicrobial competition has implications for both pathogenesis and microbiome engineering.},

	abstract = {Aim We set out to test the hypothesis that rates of pre- and post-dispersal seed predation would be higher towards the tropics, across a broad range of species from around the world. We also aimed to quantify the slope and predictive power of the relationship between seed mass and latitude both within and across species. Methods Seed mass, pre-dispersal seed predation and post-dispersal seed removal data were compiled from the literature. Wherever possible, these data were combined with information regarding the latitude at which the data were collected. Analyses were performed using both cross-species and phylogenetic regressions. Results Contrary to expectations, we found no significant relationship between seed predation and latitude (log10 proportion of seeds surviving predispersal seed predation vs. latitude, P ¼ 0.63; R2 ¼ 0.02; n ¼ 122 species: log10 proportion of seeds remaining after postdispersal seed removal vs. latitude, P ¼ 0.54; R2 ¼ 0.02; n ¼ 205 species). These relationships remained non-significant after variation because of seed mass was accounted for. We also found a very substantial (R2 ¼ 0.21) relationship between seed mass and latitude across 2706 species, with seed mass being significantly higher towards the tropics. Within-species seed mass decline with latitude was significant, but only about two-sevenths, as rapid as the cross-species decline with latitude. Results of phylogenetic analyses were very similar to cross-species analyses. We also demonstrated a positive relationship between seed mass and development time across ten species from dry sclerophyll woodland in Sydney (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001; R2 ¼ 0.77; Standardized Major Axis slope ¼ 0.14). These data lend support to the hypothesis that growing period might affect the maximum attainable seed mass in a given environment. Main conclusions There was no evidence that seed predation is higher towards the tropics. The strong relationship between seed mass and latitude shown here had been observed in previous studies, but had not previously been quantified at a global scale. There was a tenfold reduction in mean seed mass for every c. 23 moved towards the poles, despite a wide range of seed mass within each latitude.},

Stool composition correlated highly with the colonic lumen and mucosa and moderately with the distal small intestine. The mucosal microbiota varied most based on location and was enriched in oxygen-tolerant taxa (e.g., Helicobacter and Treponema), while the lumenal microbiota showed inter-individual variation and obligate anaerobe enrichment (e.g., Firmicutes). This mucosal and lumenal community variability corresponded to functional differences, such as nutrient availability. Additionally, Helicobacter, Faecalibacterium, and Lactobacillus levels in stool were highly predictive of their abundance at most other gut sites.

	abstract = {UNLABELLED: In an attempt to explore the microbial content of functionally critical niches of the mouse gastrointestinal tract, we targeted molecular microbial diagnostics of the crypts that contain the intestinal stem cells, which account for epithelial regeneration. As current evidence indicates, the gut microbiota affects epithelial regeneration; bacteria that are likely to primarily participate in this essential step of the gut, microbiota cross talk, have been identified. We show in this article that only the cecal and colonic crypts harbor resident microbiota in the mouse and that regardless of the line and breeding origin of these mice, this bacterial population is unexpectedly dominated by aerobic genera. Interestingly, this microbiota resembles the restricted microbiota found in the midgut of invertebrates; thus, the presence of our so-called "crypt-specific core microbiota" (CSCM) in the mouse colon potentially reflects a coevolutionary process under selective conditions that can now be addressed. We suggest that CSCM could play both a protective and a homeostatic role within the colon. This article is setting the bases for such studies, particularly by providing a bona fide–and essentially cultivable–crypt microbiota of reference.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nIMPORTANCE: Metagenomic typing of the whole-gut luminal microbiome was recently provided, revealing great opportunities for physiological and physiopathological analysis of the host-microbiota interface. On this basis, it appears increasingly important to analyze which niches of the gut exposed to a particular microbiota are of major functional importance, specifically focusing on the crypt, which accounts for permanent epithelial renewal, and to analyze how this microbiota compares to its luminal counterpart in composition and quantity. Crypt-specific core microbiotas may show themselves as important elements regarding crypt protection and homeostasis of its functions.},

A major barrier to mechanistic studies is the paucity of tools for genetically manipulating wild and diverse bacterial isolates. Solving this problem is crucial to elucidating the cellular and molecular rules that govern symbiotic relationships and ultimately harnessing them for agricultural and biomedical applications. Therefore, we constructed a series of vectors that expedite genetic knock-in and knock-out procedures across a range of bacterial lineages. This was accomplished by developing strategies for domestication-free bacterial conjugation, designing plasmids with customizable features, and streamlining allelic exchange using visual markers of homologous recombination. These tools enabled a comparative study based on live imaging of diverse bacterial symbionts native to the zebrafish intestine, with which we discovered heterogeneous colonization patterns and a striking correlation between bacterial population biogeography and cellular behavior.},

Our survey revealed stage-specific signatures in the intestinal microbiota and extensive interindividual variation, even within the same developmental stage. Microbial community shifts were apparent during periods of constant diet and environmental conditions, as well as in concert with dietary and environmental change. Interindividual variation in the intestinal microbiota increased with age, as did the difference between the intestinal microbiota and microbes in the surrounding environment. Our results indicate that zebrafish intestinal microbiota assemble into distinct communities throughout development, and that these communities are increasingly different from the surrounding environment and from one another.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 4 September 2015; doi:10.1038/ismej.2015.140.},

	abstract = {Particle motion in an unsteady peristaltic fluid flow is analyzed. The fluid is incompressible and Newtonian in a two-dimensional planar geometry. A perturbation method based on a small ratio of wave height to wavelength is used to obtain a closed-form solution for the fluid velocity field. This analytical solution is used in conjunction with an equation of motion for a small rigid sphere in nonuniform flow taking Stokes drag, virtual mass, Faxén, Basset, and gravity forces into account. Fluid streamlines and velocity profiles are calculated. Theoretical values for pumping rates are compared with available experimental data. An application to ureteral peristaltic flow is considered since fluid flow in the ureter is sometimes accompanied by particles such as stones or bacteriuria. Particle trajectories for parameters that correspond to calcium oxalates for calculosis and Escherichia coli type for bacteria are analyzed. The findings show that retrograde or reflux motion of the particles is possible and bacterial transport can occur in the upper urinary tract when there is a partial occlusion of the wave. Dilute particle mixing is also investigated, and it is found that some of the particles participate in the formation of a recirculating bolus, and some of them are delayed in transit and eventually reach the walls. This can explain the failure of clearing residuals from the upper urinary tract calculi after successful extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The results may also be relevant to the transport of other physiological fluids and industrial applications in which peristaltic pumping is used.},

To better understand microbial growth and population dynamics in the proximal colon, the primary region of bacterial growth in the gut, we built and applied a fluidic channel that we call the "minigut." This is a channel with an array of membrane valves along its length, which allows mimicking active contractions of the colonic wall. Repeated contraction is shown to be crucial in maintaining a steady-state bacterial population in the device despite strong flow along the channel that would otherwise cause bacterial washout. Depending on the flow rate and the frequency of contractions, the bacterial density profile exhibits varying spatial dependencies. For a synthetic cross-feeding community, the species abundance ratio is also strongly affected by mixing and flow along the length of the device. Complex mixing dynamics due to contractions is described well by an effective diffusion term. Bacterial dynamics is captured by a simple reaction-diffusion model without adjustable parameters. Our results suggest that flow and mixing play a major role in shaping the microbiota of the colon.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiota is a complex consortium of microorganisms with the ability to influence important aspects of host health and development. Harnessing this "microbial organ" for biomedical applications requires clarifying the degree to which host and bacterial factors act alone or in combination to govern the stability of specific lineages. To address this issue, we combined bacteriological manipulation and light sheet fluorescence microscopy to monitor the dynamics of a defined two-species microbiota within a vertebrate gut. We observed that the interplay between each population and the gut environment produces distinct spatiotemporal patterns. As a consequence, one species dominates while the other experiences sudden drops in abundance that are well fit by a stochastic mathematical model. Modeling revealed that direct bacterial competition could only partially explain the observed phenomena, suggesting that a host factor is also important in shaping the community. We hypothesized the host determinant to be gut motility, and tested this mechanism by measuring colonization in hosts with enteric nervous system dysfunction due to a mutation in the ret locus, which in humans is associated with the intestinal motility disorder known as Hirschsprung disease. In mutant hosts we found reduced gut motility and, confirming our hypothesis, robust coexistence of both bacterial species. This study provides evidence that host-mediated spatial structuring and stochastic perturbation of communities can drive bacterial population dynamics within the gut, and it reveals a new facet of the intestinal host-microbe interface by demonstrating the capacity of the enteric nervous system to influence the microbiota. Ultimately, these findings suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting the intestinal ecosystem should consider the dynamic physical nature of the gut environment.},
