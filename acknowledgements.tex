\acknowledge{Many thanks are due: to members of the Parthasarathy Lab past and present for their guidance and excellent company; to the greater community of researchers I have interacted with at U. Oregon, including those involved with the META center and with the Soft Matter/Biophysics group, for creating a uniquely fun and stimulating scientific environment; to my co-authors, in particular Travis Wiles and Elena Wall, for pushing this work so much farther than I ever could have taken it alone; to the research technicians that do so much foundational work to make research happen, especially zebrafish technicians including Rose Sockol, Laura Taggart-Murphy, and Sophie Sichel; to the administrative staff of the Physics Department, Materials Science Institute, and Institute of Molecular Biology for helping with a diverse array of important tasks; to the Institute of Molecular Biology for taking a chance and funding a physics student with their Training Grant program; to my advisor, Raghuveer Parthasarathy, for superb mentorship and for showing me that experiments are fun; to the rest of my committee, Eric Corwin, John Toner, and Karen Guillemin, for advice, support, and mentorship; and to the skateboarders of Oregon, for building the best parks.}
