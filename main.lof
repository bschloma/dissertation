Each image is a maximum intensity projection of a full 3D image stack, except for the top right inset, which is a single optical plane. Dashed amber lines trace the approximate boundaries of the intestine in each image. Examples of single cells (open arrowheads), small aggregates (closed arrowheads), and large aggregates (tailed arrowheads) are noted within insets under ``sub-region''. See also Supplementary Movies 1-4. Top row: Populations of \textit {V. cholerae} ZWU0020 localize to the anterior bulb and are dominated by highly motile planktonic cells (Supplementary Movie 1). Inset shows \textit {V. cholerae} ZWU0020 cells in a different fish that was colonized with 1:100 mixture of green and red variants. The dilute channel (green) is shown. Middle row: Populations of \textit {A. caviae} ZOR0002 typically contain a range of bacterial aggregate sizes, as indicated by arrows. Inset shows a zoomed-in view of the same intestine.

LRC model (no extinction) was simulated for $T_{max} = 300$ units of inverse growth rate for 5 values of the scale parameter $\alpha $, rescaling parameters according to equation (8). Frames i-v depict the stationary distribution of $\qopname \relax o{log}X$ (for visual clarity) for $\alpha = 1, 2.94, 8.66, 25.49, 75.00$ respectively, estimated from $10^6$ paths.

Parameters: $r = .68$, $K = 6800$, $\lambda = .1$, $\sigma = .8$, $\qopname \relax o{ln}f = -\sigma /\sqrt {\lambda }$, $dt = .01$. \textbf {B: } Mean time to extinction increases as the LRC model is morphed into the LES model (bottom), despite the stationary mean remaining constant throughout the transformation (top).

Parameters: $r = 1$, $f = .01$, $N_{trials} = 5000$, $\lambda $ is varied from $.06$ to $.4$. For each value of $\lambda $, $\tau $ vs $K$ is computed for 10 values of $K$ ranging from 100 to 10000. The last 5 values are used to compute $\nu $. For the LRC model, the $x$-axis corresponds to $\sigma ^2 = \lambda \qopname \relax o{ln}^2f$.
